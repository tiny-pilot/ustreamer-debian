Description: Lightweight and fast MJPEG-HTTP streamer
 µStreamer is a lightweight and very quick server to stream MJPEG video
 from any V4L2 device to the net. All new browsers have native
 support of this video format, as well as most video players such as
 mplayer, VLC etc. µStreamer is a part of the PiKVM project designed to
 stream VGA and HDMI screencast hardware data with the highest resolution
 and FPS possible.
